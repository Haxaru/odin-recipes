# odin-recipes
In this project I will be demonstrating all that I have learned up until now which I believe will be by using git commands to commit/push it to github and other HTML knowledge such as links, images, lists, and other things like using text with different sizes. 
UPDATE: I actually had a ton of trouble with using git and how to commit and push it into the Github repository. After many videos I still had no idea what I was doing and what the messages that were popping up meant. Finally I decided to delete the repository and create a new one. From there, I followed the steps similarly to the Git Basics lesson. It is clear I need to review committing and pushing into the Github repository through the terminal. One thing I didn't understand was towards the end of the Recipe Project where I altered the branch from 'none' to 'main'. What was the purpose for it and what was it supposed to do?
UPDATE FOR THE UPDATE:
This entire thing is a mess and I still had no idea what I was doing with the git commands :')
