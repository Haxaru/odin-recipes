    <h1>About This Dish</h1>
    <p>
      A juicy and flavorful carne asada starts with a delicious carne asada marinade. This recipe begins with a 24-hour
      marinade to allow the flank steak to soak up all the tasty and fresh flavors before grilling. Whether you serve it
      as tacos, a salad topping, or simply chow down on the tender, flavor-packed steak by itself, this will be the best
      carne asada you've ever experienced.
